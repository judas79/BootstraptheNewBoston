This lesson is about tables.  There are a bunch of different tables you can have, but first we will be concentrating on
simple table, condensed table and a striped table.  When creating a, simple table, or all tables, first you have to set
the generic class to, table, within the <table> tags.  Within the 'simple' <table> tag, there are many rows, in which we
will set up our columns.  We will also be splitting our rows into a <head> and <body>.  The <head> will be useful for
providing a label for the titles of what is contained in the <body> of data.  In the <head> is also where we will be
creating the rows; <tr>.  Within the rows <tr> we will make the headers <th> for our rows and supply a name for them:

        <h2>simple table</h2>
        <table class = 'table'>
            <head>
                <tr>
                    <th>Name</th>
                    <th>Age</th>
                    <th>Points</th>

                </tr>

            </head>
            <body></body>
        </table>

Within the <body>, we will use regular table rows <tr>.  Within the regular table rows, we will have table data <td>,
that we will have data corresponding to the table headers created above.

           <body>
                <tr>
                    <td>John</td>
                    <td>55</td>
                    <td>9997</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Sass</td>
                    <td>59</td>
                    <td>9993</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Rodman Vain Rachell</td>
                    <td>58</td>
                    <td>9998</td>
                </tr>
            </body>

The next type of table is condensed.  These tables are not as spread out, as the simple table, are.  They are tightly
spaced.  The only difference between the simple and condensed table, is that we use two classes of tables, when defining
the type, just before the <head>and <body>, which remain the same.  The rows have less padding on them, so are more
condensed:

        <h2>Condensed table</h2>
        <table class = 'table table-condensed'>

This is also true, for the striped table; we uses two classes to define the type of table, before the <head> and <body>.
The rows background lines are more distinguished, by coloring the background, light grey, of every other line, when
using the striped class of table.

        <h2>Striped Table</h2>
        <table class = 'table table-striped'>

All three class types of tables look good, when the window is re-sized.  There are more classes of table classes listed
in the Bootstrap site.



********************* Highlights from the comments area ***************************





Btw, Intellij IDEA (and other IDE's from Jetbrains I assume) has built-in emmet support. Meaning that you can type "td"
and then press TAB to create a set of matching "td"-tags. The entire structure for the first table Bucky created can be
generated with "table.table>thead>tr>th*3^^tbody>(tr>td*3)*3" and then TAB. Just had to mention this when seeing Bucky's
difficulties ;P

On Point! I am using " table.table>(thead>tr>th*3)>tbody>tr*3>td*3 " then TAB. I am assuming "^^" is used to start a new
 tag. I am not sure, can you comment on this? I am using emmet on Sublime Text 3.

'^' moves up to the parent level. In this case '^^' means you move up two levels, first to a level with 'tr' as sibling
and 'thead' as parent, then to a level with 'thead' as sibling and 'table' as parent.
For further reference: http://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/





if you want to autocomplete tags, type a tag name without angle braces and hit Tab!Try it, it might work





I thought it is a bad idea to use tables for layout and it is heavily discouraged?

Yes. Using tables for layout is generally discouraged. However, using tables to represent data is what they're
made for :)





hey guys just to add on, there's a huge difference  between "<table class="table">" and "<table class="Table">" in this
example we use the second piece of code of you use the first one you'll have an ugly looking web page

You meant if you use the second piece of code you get an ugly looking page. The first piece of code works just fine





Great tutorial!
