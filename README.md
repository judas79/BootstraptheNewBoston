This will be the notes, code, and highlights from the comments area, from Bucky Roberts beginner online tutorial, 
consisting of, the bootstrap framework development, and other dependencies or related items.  The tutorial is located 
here:

I will be using jetbrains PyCharm pro 2019 and bootstrap version 3.41, the version in the tutorial is a slightly 
earlier version.  The user can copy and use the software contained in this:  judas79/BootstraptheNewBoston repository, 
for whatever insane coding desired.

Within the code there will be L01 - L14, to indicate which Lesson the line or block was implemented.  In the highlights
from the comments area; large spaces are between post topics, and lines of single space in between, are sub-answers and 
sub-comments from other posters, within a posters topic.  Sometimes there are single lines of space between a posters
comments, and the code he posted, for readability purposes.
