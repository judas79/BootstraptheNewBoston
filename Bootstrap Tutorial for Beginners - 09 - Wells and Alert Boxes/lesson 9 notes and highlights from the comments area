We will leave the navigation menu bar as is, and work on wells.  First we will set up our container for the main part
of the website, within <div> tags:

    <div class = 'container'>

A well is kind of like a floating island that is, 'separate', with a border, and usually a grey background.  We will now
add a heading for this section:

        <!-- well: bordered area with grey background-->
        <h2>Well area</h2>

Now we will use the well class, within <div> tags to make a basic, small 'well well-sm', or large 'well well-lg' well:

        <!-- create a basic, small, or large well-->
        <div class = "well">Basic Well</div>
        <div class = "well well-sm">Small Well</div>
        <div class = "well well-lg">Large Well</div>

There are well boxes that are used a lot, as alert boxes, when filling out forms online, to show completion in green, or
errors in red, in the responses, submitted by the user.  Also 'alert' wells, are used for notifications, such as birthdays,
appointments and such...  Alert boxes use the alert class, to make these specific colored, type of wells:

        <!--alert wells with colored backgrounds-->
        <div class = "alert alert-success">Congrats, you won</div>

Most of these alert well boxes are made to popup and need a mechanism to close them.  We use a link, within link tags <a>
with an actual link or a blank one, and the class 'close'. We will also need to dismiss the data and close the label,
within the alert box using data-dismiss ='alert' and aria-label="close" to achieve closure of the popup.  To create the
clickable close/ times for multiplication, 'X' we use   &times;   which will render html into a graphic, where we
usually add the text between > IN HERE </a>

        <!--closable link, with alert box-->
        <div class = "alert alert-danger">
            <a href="#" class ='close' data-dismiss ='alert' aria-label="close">&times;</a>error</div>

To make a closable alert well, fade, instead of closing immediately, we add fade in after creating the alert button in
the <div> tag area:

            <div class = "alert alert-warning fade in">
            <a href="#" class ='close' data-dismiss ='alert' aria-label="close">&times;</a>error</div>

whoa.. fade out are actually called fade in on bootstrap..






Replaced with <card> in Bootstrap 4.





My question is, why we need to use the <a> element to contained the "x"?

<span> tag works for me:
<div class = "alert alert-warning fade in">
            <span href="#" class ='close' data-dismiss ='alert' aria-label="close">&times;</span>error</div>
