This lesson will show some of the text styling defaults built into Bootstrap. First we will use
the highlight <mark> tags, to highlight words or text:

        <!--highlight text <mark>  </mark>-->
        <p>you can <mark>highlight words</mark> or text using the mark tags</p>

You use <blockquote> to make quotes, within the blockquote we use <p> for the quote and <footer> for the author of the
quote.  This will give the text proper spacing and use different text to enhance the style:

        <!--<blockquote> <p>text in tags like between</p> then <footer> with the authors name</footer></blockquote>-->
        <blockquote>
            <p>This is where the quote goes</p>
            <footer>Authors Name</footer>
        </blockquote>

************************************************************************************************************************
   In this lesson we began using the older version, CDN links, instead of the downloaded bootstrap files, because the
   style of the blockqoute was more pronounced.  We kept the downloaded Bootstrap files in the main directory, in case
   there is no access, or failure, to the CDN links.
************************************************************************************************************************

Next we will make a list using <dl> and <dt> and <dd> tags.  First we use <h4> to make a heading.  <dl> is the main
container for the list <dt> is for the list topics and <dd> is for the list items:

        <h4>This is how you make a list</h4>

        <!--The list container-->
        <dl>
            <!--list title-->
            <dt>Indoors</dt>

                <!--the list items-->
                <dd>sleep</dd>
                <dd>watch TV</dd>
                <dd>eat</dd>

            <dt>Outdoors</dt>

                <dd>go inside</dd>
                <dd>drink</dd>
        </dl>

This is how you make syntax highlighting for documentation code for an API or coding site like, github.  It is styled to
let the viewer know, that it is special 'documentation', for instance source code.  We use <code> to perform this
syntax highlighting for single lines.

        <!--Use <code> tags to highlight single line snippets of code-->
        <p>Highlight the <code>sourceCode(self)</code>then return to normal text</p>



        <!--use the pre-formatted tag, for multiline blocks of code -->
        <p>use pre for multiline blocks of code
        <pre>

        num = float(input("Enter a number: "))
        if num >= 0:
            if num == 0:
                print("Zero")
            else:
                print("Positive number")
        else:
            print("Negative number")

        </pre>code ended</p>

If you want the <pre> code to be more to the left or right, align it accordingly, in Pycharm using tab to go
right and shift+tab to go left, after selecting the block of code you want to move.

Next, if you are giving someone a lesson that involves pushing down keyboard keys, use the <key> tag,
to make them stick out.

        <!--for instructions involving pressing certain keyboard keys use <kbd>-->
        <p>This is for keyboard combination press <kbd>Ctrl+Alt+Del</kbd></p>


We use contextual colors, for forms and other online items, the user may have to fill out, to show errors, for instance,
red, and green for correct entries:

        <!--classes of contextual colors for forms-->
        <h4>Built-in contextual colors</h4>

        <!--for non-clickable text use class='text-muted' 'grey'-->
        <p class ='text-muted'>Text Muted; color is grey</p>

        <!--use class ='text-success', for forms filled out correctly; color is green-->
        <p class ='text-success'>form filled out correctly; color is green</p>

        <!--use class ='text-danger' if form filled out incorrectly; color is red -->
        <p class ='text-danger'>Text is wrong danger; color is red</p>

These Bootstrap contextual color classes enable coloration of text, without using custom CSS classes, and are the same for
background colors.

        <!--use class ='bg-success', for forms filled out correctly; color is green-->
        <p class ='bg-success'>form filled out correctly; color is green</p>

        <!--use class ='bg-danger' if form filled out incorrectly; color is red -->
        <p class ='bg-danger'>Text is wrong danger; color is red</p>

These text styles are know as 'topography'.

Hey Bucky, I'm using bootstrap and am also copying those files/text that are required, you know the ones provided in
their website in the start. Also,  have downloaded bootstrap and have copied the css, js, fonts packages in my project
BUT, the page that I design, it does not look the way it should. I have used their example pages and their source code
but my page looks just different and not like the ones that they have designed. Could you or anyone  else please help
or suggest something.

Try it in Chrome or Firefox. Sometimes, it doesn't display well in IE or Edge

yeah I've been using it on Chrome. well that is not working I don't know why.:(

I was using the downloaded updated 2020 Bootstrap version,  and the rendering in the browser, was different than the
examples in the video.  I left the downloaded files, in the main directory, and switched to the older CDN files links,
Bucky supplied, and then the rendering in the browser matched the tutorial, in google chrome.




There are some things not working for me:
1. the <blockquote> element isn't displaying the line on the left and even the background colour hasn't changed for me.
2. The text written in <pre>tag isn't being displayed inside the box as is shown in this video.
3. The "bg-success" and "bg-danger" aren't working as well. I'm getting just plain white text.

Can somebody please help me out here ?

Guessing bootstrap has changed since this video came out :/

Try an older version of CDN Bootstrap.





Blockquoute doesn't work. Try
<blockquoute class=blockquoute">
<p>Text goes here like grandpa bed wetting</p>

<footer class="blockquoute-footer"> From Bucky </footer>
</blockquoute>

I was just wondering why isn't it working? Different version of bootstrap or something? It works with the classes you
provided, thanks for that ðŸ˜€


<blockquote class="blockquote">
  <p class="mb-0">i wet the bed.</p>
  <footer class="blockquote-footer">Someone famous in <cite title="Source Title">Source Title</cite></footer>
</blockquote>






Try using the <small> tag if <footer> doesn't work.





How come for me this code returns everything in seperate rows.

<div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-4" style="background-color: #FF9999">Left</div>
            <div class="col-md-4" style="background-color: #99CCFF">Middle</div>
            <div class="col-md-4" style="background-color: #00CC99">Right</div>
        </div>

also container and container-fluid returns the full screen width. is this a browser issue ?

never mind i figured it out .. the CDN page referencing to stylesheet was blocked.






<blockquote> isn't working :(


Same! I'm following along and it doesn't work for me either. Looks like a pretty cool feature.

Check the bootstrap version you're using. If you're using bootstrap 4, the syntax is a bit different:
<blockquote class="blockquote">
     <p> Text here </p>
     <footer class="blockquote-footer"> Anonymous</footer>
    </blockquote>


<blockquote class="blockquote">
  <p class="mb-0">i wet the bed</p>
  <footer class="blockquote-footer">Someone famous in <cite title="Source Title">Source Title</cite></footer>
</blockquote>







I think they intended it to work this way (keyboard):
<p>This is supposed to be keyboard input <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Del</kbd>.</p>
