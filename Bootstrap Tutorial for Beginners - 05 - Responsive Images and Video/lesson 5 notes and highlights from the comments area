In this lesson we will looks at responsive and unresponsive images and the differences between the two. We will see how
to embed responsive videos, without looking terrible on the website.  First we will look at some basic image classes.
The first one is the 'image' class <img> tag, so put some images in a sub-directory we are working in.  We will first
write the path, to the image then round the corners of an image using; class ='img-rounded' and give it a specific
width and height:

        <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/CFSV2/obituaries/photos/8283/670783/5d53182f7965b.jpg" class="img-rounded" width="230" height="230">
        <img src="images/dad2.jpg" class="img-rounded" width="230" height="230">
        <img src="images/dad.jpg" class="img-circle" width="230" height="230">

A responsive class images width, is resizeable if the window is made smaller.  Unresponsive images, will not have a
class assigned to it:

        <!--using non-responsive no class, and responsive that will adjust if width is mad smaller-->
        <img src="images/dad.jpg">
        <img src="images/red.jpg" class="img-responsive">
        <img src="images/band.jpg" class="img-responsive" width="230" height="230">

Next we will make a video responsive.  Within another pair of <div> tags add the code to resize whatever we stick in it,
in this case a video, and the dimensions are 16x9.  Within the <div> we will enter a youtube video, using <iframe> tags.
When looking at a YouTube video, the usable address, of the video comes after the v=, playlist videos don't work,
using this method.  Working example:

SQLZG6yigQs

in:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQLZG6yigQs

For the embedding, of a responsive video, with a standard size window 16x9, we use:

        <div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9">
            <iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/SQLZG6yigQs"></iframe>
        </div>

with url parameters, of the video you want within <iframe>.  Since this is responsive, it will take up most of the width
of the screen, but condense down, when re-sized or on a cell phone or tablet.



****************** highlights from the comments area ***********************





bootstrap gives you a css stylesheet, so we cannot include our own style sheet ?

You include Bootstrap's stylesheet first and yours after.





can i have an id for a div, which already has a class attribute, for css purposes?

Yes you can






why do you have to include the "embed" in the youtube link? It does not work if I just post the direct video link. So
if i have my own video on my harddrive, how do i make it responsive(without uploading it to youtube)?

Just add video tags and put the src attribute to the video directory





so how can you make an image be circle and responsive at once? How can you use both classes at once? Great tuts, mate.

Hello, probably you already know it, but i was experimenting a bit and this one works:
<img src="images/image.png" class="img-responsive img-circle"></img>





how to re-size the image? I mean without re-sizing the whole browser?

Set a CSS property called 'width-min' and 'width-max'.





For video it's not working.
why?

Maybe you used a video from a playlist instead a regular youtube video.  The identifying portion of a playlist video has
more characters than a regular videos suffix.  The playlist videos didn't work for me either, not sure why...





In the newest version of Bootstrap, the classes should be:

img class="rounded"
img class="rounded-circle"
img-responsive is now img-fluid
