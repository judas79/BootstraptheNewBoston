Bootstrap is a framework development environment to create cross device websites.
It will make these websites interchangeably to look good, for varying sizes of displays, from small cell phones to
large screen monitors.  This ability makes bootstrap very popular.

The Bootstrap software can be obtained from:

https://getbootstrap.com/

The end user can click the "Download" button extract  the three files, and put them in every
directory page that uses bootstrap, or use a CDN (content delivery network), to use the files from a remote server, and
put those, on the top of every page that uses Bootstrap.  I will do both here, but comment out
the CDV, for learning purposes, but to keep the CDN and local files from conflicting.

The three folders, in the download, to include in all bootstrap pages:

css
fonts
js

The other method using the newest, Feb. 2020, version of bootstrap CDN:

CSS only:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.4.1/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-Vkoo8x4CGsO3+Hhxv8T/Q5PaXtkKtu6ug5TOeNV6gBiFeWPGFN9MuhOf23Q9Ifjh" crossorigin="anonymous">

JS, Popper.js, and jQuery:

<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.slim.min.js" integrity="sha384-J6qa4849blE2+poT4WnyKhv5vZF5SrPo0iEjwBvKU7imGFAV0wwj1yYfoRSJoZ+n" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/popper.js@1.16.0/dist/umd/popper.min.js" integrity="sha384-Q6E9RHvbIyZFJoft+2mJbHaEWldlvI9IOYy5n3zV9zzTtmI3UksdQRVvoxMfooAo" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script src="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.4.1/js/bootstrap.min.js" integrity="sha384-wfSDF2E50Y2D1uUdj0O3uMBJnjuUD4Ih7YwaYd1iqfktj0Uod8GCExl3Og8ifwB6" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

The template, for index.html, contents, can be found here:

https://github.com/buckyroberts/Source-Code-from-Tutorials/blob/master/Bootstrap/001_template.html

We will now explain the CDNs line by line:

The viewport, in this first CDN, is essentially the viewer screen, the 'width' is the width of the screen and
'initial-scale'means do not zoom in or out in any special way; use regular zoom in every device:

<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

The next on is where we get all the CSS default; styling, coloring and look of all the different widgets:

<link rel="stylesheet" href="http://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.4/css/bootstrap.min.css">

And the two script CDN's one is for the standard jquery library and the other for the javascript bootstrap file

<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="http://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.4/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>

The <body> HERE </body>, will be the starting point for every boostrap page we make.

We will now start designing the website.  Almost everything within a website has to go in a container.  There are
two types of containers to choose from, for the 'class':

'container'      # a fixed size screen, container
'conainer-fluid' # full size scree, container

In the index.htm we will begin by setting up the container:

 <!--  set up the container size, heading a paragraph text-->
    <div class=" container">
        <h1>Welcome to Roddy's</h1>
        <p>We love theNewBoston, my name is Roddy</p>

    </div>

Then we will run this in PyCharm and view it on our browser.

Bucky please don't give people bad advice. Including bootstrap links from some random 3rd party website instead of
having inside your project is a BAD PRACTICE. Any real programmer with at least 1 year exp will completely agree with me.
Bucky you should have said something like "In this tutorial we will be using links but in reality always download
bootstrap"





Biiiip, wrong: A CDN is NOT, just a server, but a whole NETWORK of them, working together with specially designed
algorithms, in order to provide High Fault Tolerance: It ensires the CONTENT DELIVERY. ;) use google, it's new, you type
words, hit enter, and then...

He was talking about it at a higher level, it's not a networking tutorial

I was just completing, then. Which is pretty much of a very impotant point: Take any developer, it is not good, if not
catastrophic, uif that developer has no clue how his developed features are packaged for production. And why. It feel
it especially is true in the context: any person watching the video, willing to work in front web dev, has to hear about
the packaging, eg, how do you work/test while you work with sass / less . css ? All in all, the CDN stuff is a
dependency of the front web developer's work. As such, it i, I think, a most important thing for him to be curious
about it.

Indeed a CDN is specifically implemented with servers ideally spread around the world. The purpose is to keep multiple
caches of often reused files & route the traffic to the closest server thus minimizing latency. Familiarity with CDN's
doesn't magically impart knowledge of Bootstrap or any other of the 10,001 web frameworks out there so this is still a
worthwhile view to anyone.

One more worth to mention, , very much so, I believe, characteristics of today's CDN service  offer: What Mr. Sticky ...
is that there is some caching alon,g the routing. Well, today's CDN offers propose you this : Your web site stays on
line, ... EVenn if your provider shut down your server!...
See?




So, basically a bootstrap is something like a theme; a prepared css, js and fonts and i just need to copy/pasta that to
my folder and no need to install? then i just need to add a valid class names in my htmls to manipulate its content?




Pasting the CDN  link need internet access. I think downloading bootstrap is better choice for testing purpose




Pre requisites to learn bootstrap ???

html5 and css3 ,hope that clarifies
