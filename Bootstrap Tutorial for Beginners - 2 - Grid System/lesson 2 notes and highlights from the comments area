In this lesson we will be designing layouts, in Bootstrap, using the grid system.  In Bootstrap we can have a
maximum, of 12 columns.  We can group all 12 columns into 1, if we only want 1 column.  For example if we want a side
bar, we could group 2 columns together and use the other 10 for Text space.
The grid system in Bootstrap has 4 different classes, which relate to the different device you are designing it for:

xs  extra small, for phones
sm  small, for tablets
md  medium, for desktops and laptops
lg  large, for I-macs and other large screens.

We can use these classes to specify how many columns for which type of device, for example;
for a laptop you want 2 columns and for a phone you may want only 1, depending on what device is used
We will be using, one size fits all (md), that is responsive to all devices, in this tutorial.
We will start, in index.py, and make a simple web page that uses 3 columns and takes up the entire width of the screen.
Instead of 'container' we will us 'container-fluid':

    <--  allows, to take up entire width of the screen -->
    <div class=" container-fluid">

        <-- our header -->
        <h1>3 column layout</h1>

To have columns you have to have rows and in this row we will have 3 columns.  To make 3 columns out of 12 possible, we
will have 4 bundled together for each row, in class column, with medium for size:

        <div class='row'>

            <!-- regular column spanning for columns, with background color, text 'First' -->
            <div class='col-md-4'>style="background-color: #FF9999">Left</div>
            <div class='col-md-4'>style="background-color: #555555">Middle</div>
            <div class='col-md-4'>style="background-color: #007777">Right</div>

        </div>

If the window is re-sized, the columns will be converted, on the fly, to piled rows, which would be easier to view on a
small device such as a cell phone.  If we used a regular container the column span would not span the entire width of
the screen, and would have a set span width, with the screen blank on either side.
