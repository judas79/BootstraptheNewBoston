In this lesson 7, we will add dropdown menus to the main navigation menu items, we created in lesson 6.  But first we
will change the default style of the main navigation bar, from navbar-default (light grey) to navbar inverse (black).

    <!--set up the navigation bar, navbar it the navigation bar and navbar-inverse instead of navbar-default, is the style-->
    <nav class="navbar navbar-inverse">

Next we will make the menu dropdown item, by adding another item to the list, with more menu items within it.  We will
use the dropdown class to do this and an arrow pointing downwards, using the carot class within <span> tags, to make the
icon, that indicates that it is a dropdown menu, next to the drop downs text; 'My Profile'.  We will also make a links
that exist within the drop down menu.  To give this a dropdown characteristics instead of just a dead link, <a href=""
we will change the drop down class to class="dropdown-toggle", followed by a class attribute data-toggle=, which we set
to 'dropdown'.  So now when you click My Profile it doesn't function like a regular link, but instead it works as a
dropdown:

                    <li class='dropdown'>
                        <a href="" class="dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown">My Profile <span class="caret"></span></a>

Next we will create the actual submenu items.  First we have to change the class to dropdown-menu so the program knows
that it isn't just normal menu items, within an unordered list <ul>.

                        <!--The sub menu items go in here-->
                        <ul class='dropdown-menu'>

                            <!--Not in this lesson; open in new window or tab, open email browser-->
                            <li><a href="https://www8.hp.com/us/en/home.html" target="_blank">My website</a></li>
                            <li><a href="mailto: abc@example.com">My email</a></li>
                       </ul>
                    </li>

Next we will make an unordered list <ul> whose items will take up the right side of the navigation menu.  We will make a
logout to click on.  We will also use a class with 3 elements within it.  NOTE: We tried using 2 elements and the Logout
link was in an active state.  Also, NOT in the lesson, we added a help item:

                <!--Right aligned navigation menu items-->
                <ul class="nav navbar-nav navbar-right">
                    <li><a href="">Logout</a></li>
                    <li><a href="">Help</a></li>
                </ul>





********************* highlights from the comments area ********************





I am wondering why Icant get the dropdown menu work...  I am using the template..

@Jason Ng you have to include the jQuery, as well. Bootstrap's JavaScript needs it. I am not sure if it is included in
the template.

@Jason Ng Just attache this before closing the body element...

<script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js"></script>
<script src="js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>


+Jason Ng Include JQuery before anything bootstrap related

+Marko Terzic: Regardless other commentaries your solution works just fine. Thanks

@Efren Chavez It works, yes. But it is not good form. When you are including javascript file to be used throughout the
whole page, you do it in the head section. If including a javascript file in that place will hinder whatever the site
does, then and then ONLY you include within the body

+Yadu PIllai It's a good idea to place scripts at the bottom of the <body> element. This can improve page load, because
HTML display is not blocked by scripts loading.


@Yadu PIllai As Marko commented is a good practice place this kind of Java Script at the bottom, so your pages can be
displayed faster. Anyway you can place such Java Scripts on the head of your HTML document, it's up to you.

However the Script:
<script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-latest.min.js"></script>
Don't be placed on production sites, as the Site Stack Overflow recommend (use the number version properly)

@Efren Chavez How do we confirm that JQuery and JavaScript styles and changes the document before it loads? Many times,
this occurs too late, albeit a fraction of a second because there isn't much content, but the delay is still noticeable.






Anybody having problems try using jQuery 2.x !!!! Bootstrap won't work with jQuery 3.x

+Matt Corby Thank you. I reverted to an older version of jQuery and it worked. But I am far from impressed.
We have to use an OLDER version of jQuery at times in order to get something working with Bootstrap? This completely
defies the general requirement to keep up-to-date with latest versions!
I'm really not enjoying using Bootstrap at the moment and with examples such as this, it seems like more hassle than
it's worth! And the naming of nested classes is just awful! How the heck do developers remember it? Or is it pretty much
standard practice to grab code snippets as required?
I've gone from using pure HTML and CSS to trying to use the 'popular' Bootstrap to speed things up and I thought it was
easy to learn and use, but it doesn't seem to be easy. :-(





I noticed that in the below code, the dropdown works fine after eliminating class="dropdown" in 1st line and class="dropdown-toggle" in 2nd line. Only keeping data-toggle="dropdown" in 2nd line is enough, so whats the importance of other two classes?

<li class="dropdown">
                        <a href="#" class="dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown">My Profile <span class="caret"></span></a>
                        <ul class="dropdown-menu">
                            <li><a href="#">Friends</a></li>
                            <li><a href="#">Photos</a></li>
                            <li><a href="#">Settings</a></li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>








To those that the dropdown isn't working, try to put the 'class="dropdown-toggle" data-toggle="dropdown" '
at the <a> tag instead of the <li> tag. the <li> should have the class="dropdown" though.






dropdown not working @bucky

Include the latest version of JQuery above your bootstrap.js:
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.1.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
