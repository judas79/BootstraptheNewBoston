In this lesson we will continue adding to the navigation menu.  We will add a toggle button to give the functionality
of the screen to resize properly for mobile devices.  As the navigation menu is now, it takes up 1/3 of the viewing
portion of the window, when re-sized for a mobile device.  You would have to scroll down from the very bottom to see any
of the content of the page. So we will make the button collapse or expand the navigation menu.  We will first use a <div>
tag to give the menu items, the functionality to expand and collapse.  We also want to give the menu items bar area, an
id:, so the toggle button to refer to it to expand or collapse, as an identifiable object.

            <!--make the nav. bar collapsible using these classes and id-->
            <div class="collapse navbar-collapse">

We will put the code, for the nav bar button, below the navbar header and above the navbar logo. The button has 4
different types of attributes we have to make:  type which is button, class which is toggle, data type which is what it's
going to do; collapse something, and the target we are collapsing or expanding using the hash tag + id, for id of the
target:

                <!--toggle collapse or expand, 4 attributes, button-->
                <button type='button' class="navbar-toggle" data-toggle="collapse" datatype="#mainNavBar"></button>

Next we will make the option toggle button, that looks kind of like a hamburger (3 short horizontal lines), where the
menu items will live, while the window is in a collapsed state.  We place this between, <button> HERE </button> in
between <span> tags and use the icon-bar class.  We repeat the code 3 times, one for every horrizontal line, in the
options logo:

                    <!--the toggle collapse button, icon-->
                    <span class="icon-bar"></span>
                    <span class="icon-bar"></span>
                    <span class="icon-bar"></span>





****************** highlights from the comments area **********************



You could have also used the built-in Glyphicons for the toggle instead of each line, specifically
glyphicon glyphicon-menu-hamburger as the style for one span.






There is a glyphicon for the hamburger icon:
<span class=" glyphicon glyphicon-menu-hamburger" aria-hidden="true" style="color:white"></span>





My navbar isn't collapsing. I have copied the code exactly. Can you please post full code on forum please?

Here's the full code from thenewboston:

I did include. Turns out it was the wrong version :-(

If you put boostrap script tag before ajax.googleapis tag,then it won't toggle.
put jquery googleapis link before bootstrap script like this:

<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
   <script src="https://maxcdn.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/3.3.4/js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>







What if i want that collapse without shrinking the window size?
How can i get that collapse button on desktop size?

I found a way to put it on desktop size??
Just do a button(with the 3 icon-bar styles) that has a dropdown like last video and then just navbar-right to it.
